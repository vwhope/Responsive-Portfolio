# Responsive-Portfolio
Vicki Hope - Responsive-Portfolio
The point of this exercise is to NOT use Bootstrap built-in responsive classes,
but instead use only HTML, CSS and Media Queries (access user environment settings to best
determine how to display the page to the user). JavaScript is not required.

The @media rule adds a block of css properties, ONLY if the specified
condition in the @media statement is true.
